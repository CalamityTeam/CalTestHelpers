The Calamity-based testing mod is now public due to the growing amount of Calamity Addons that require its services

This mod provides various services, such as:

- A GUI that provides certain utilities, such as revealing the entire map, setting your spawnpoint at your current location,
toggling permanent upgrades and deaths, and toggling enemy spawns

- Infinite Money in your first coin slot,

- Map-based teleportation

- Item damage, useTime, and useAnimation manipulation

- Projectile i-frame manipulation,

- Universal stealth stat damage factor manipulation

- A game-time based boss kill timer

- Some boss summoning items (Anahita, EoL, Duke Fishron and Old Duke)

- Instant summoning for some bosses (SCal and Draedon)
